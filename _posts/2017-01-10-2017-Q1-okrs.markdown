[OKR (Objective - Key Result)](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) is a goal setting framework which Google uses internally. 

OKRs work in the following way:
+ OKR consists of an individual's Objectives for a specific time frame, which are each backed by a few specific and measurable key results (3-4) 
+ Each key result can be graded on a scale of 0 to 1 at the end of the set timeframe 
+ Key results should be stretch goals that make the individual uncomfortable with accomplishing at the point of setting it, and should average a score of 0.7 on the above-mentioned scale
+ Google's OKRs are built to run over a quarter
+ Other [SMART](http://www.yourcoach.be/en/coaching-tools/smart-goal-setting.php) goal setting tactics should also apply in this exercise 

Based on my understanding, the point of Google implementing OKRs is to assist in teamwork between different people in their organization. As OKRs are made to be public, and are not linked to the KPIs of any single employee (ie: achieving a good or bad score in the OKR will in no way affect how your work is judged), people can afford to freely express what company and individual goals they want to achieve with the OKRs without restrain. This helps to build the open culture that Google prides itself on, where people from other departments who do not know you could understand what you are trying to achieve this quarter just by looking at your OKR. OKRs also assist in aligning the objectives of project members to the key results of project leaders, ensuring that people are aligned in a specific project.

Despite OKRs mainly being a coordinating goal setting framework for large teams, I want to use OKRs to chart my daily progress too, as I require a goal setting framework anyway. These OKRs will be re-evaluated and re-set every 3 months in my time here in the bay area. The following details my OKRs for this quarter (Jan to March 2017):
