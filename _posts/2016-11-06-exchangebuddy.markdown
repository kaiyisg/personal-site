ExchangeBuddy is a platform to connect students going on student exchange programs. The portal is also an information source for students currently on exchange to reflect and share the tips and stories they come up with during exchange. ExchangeBuddy was [featured](https://www.facebook.com/exchangebuddy/posts/790833187723168) in Singaporean local chinese newspaper [LianheZaobao](http://www.zaobao.com.sg/), and on the National University of Singapore's [post](https://www.facebook.com/exchangebuddy/posts/806537456152741). ExchangeBuddy also came in 3rd in its category in [STePS](http://isteps.comp.nus.edu.sg/event/10th-steps), the School of Computing Term Project Showcase from NUS that showcases selected student projects.
