The dandelyon probe is meant to be deployed in disaster striken areas to detect survivors, and is especially useful in earthquake disaster zones to find people under rubble. The probe detects changes in its surroundings from a variety of sensors, including accelerometer, sound, and RF sensors. Upon detection from these sensors, the probe, which is built on top of the Particle Electron, connects to the Particle cloud, and visualizes data of the probe's location on using Azure services, including Microsoft Power BI for visualization. This project was hacked during [Treehacks 2017](https://www.treehacks.com/), and was one of the top 8 finalist, in addition to winning the "Best Overall Integration and Use of Microsoft Technology" API Prize.
