Giveaway is a platform for people to give away second hand goods that they no longer require, contributing to the concept of a [circular economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy). I built the android version of this application, linking up the application with a RESTful backend. I worked on Giveaway during an internship at [IQUII](https://iquii.com/).
