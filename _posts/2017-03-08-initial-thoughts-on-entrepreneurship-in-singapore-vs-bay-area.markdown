Inspired partially by my time here in the bay area for the past 2 months taking [entreprenurship classes](http://etl.stanford.edu/), and also this [video](http://ecorner.stanford.edu/videos/4684/Entrepreneurship-Strengthens-a-Nation-Entire-Talk) by Steve Blank, this post details a few of my thoughts on how the bay area became what it is, and also how Singapore can change to get closer to emulating the startup scene here.

1. Focus on engineering (design thinking, etc) of gvt
2. Get patents and IPs and go out and found companies (pre req)
3. Need big VCs to come in to match passion and vision of all the tech people (back to 1, no focus (govt) and passion (people) in engineering)
4. Big question - is being lean more important, or having tech expertise? i think it is a culture thing?
5. Current CA of density of capital and talent

Singapore didn't value Engineering in the past, but it does now.
