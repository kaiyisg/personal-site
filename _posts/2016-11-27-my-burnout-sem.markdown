Suffice to say that I had slightly [more on my plate](https://kaikaiyi.wordpress.com/) than I bargained for in my Y3S2, and getting through the semester was not easy for me. I know everyone has had **that** crazy semester, and have dealt with it in their own ways. For myself, I fell into an unhealthy mindset, framing my thoughts in the following paradigms:
+ I constantly question why I am doing the things I am doing, and am uncomfortable not being able to resolve this concern
+ I think that my stressors are larger and more important than other people's stressors, and find it harder to empathize with other people's stressors
+ I think that I am alone in my struggles with all my stressors, and have little to no support in my struggles
+ I think I am constantly behind the curve as compared to all the things I am trying to achieve, and have to keep working to keep up with what I am trying to achieve

After my experience that semester, it brought me to thinking about how an individual could avoid being caught up in such situations in the future. I want to develop strategies to stay ahead of any situation or stressor I may encounter in the future, and I believe that effective self awareness and management is the key to this. The list below details some of the changes that I will introduce into my life to ensure this:

### *Self discovery of what I want*
Knowing what you want is not something that can be discovered overnight, and is actually something more people than you expect are struggling with. Some people are more comfortable with this self-doubt and even revel in the opportunities, while others bemoan this lack of clarity. I feel that the key is to never stop thinking about what you want, and set aside a structured way to discover this in your daily life. No one can tell you what you want; people can only share how they discovered what they personally want to do, and facilitate you in your journey. I will set aside a way to discover this in my life daily, and set my goals to build towards what I want to do.

### *Designing my life*
Designing of your life ties in extremely closely with self discovery, and advocates developing and testing of many different hypothesis of your life in multiple iterations, in true design thinking fashion. The key resource I want to try to apply is Dave Evan's [Designing Your Life](http://designingyour.life/) way of thinking, trying to apply concepts in Design Thinking to designing your own life. Some of his [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syJONL-pkyQ&t=131s) on this topic could also be useful as a starting point to explore along this path.

### *Goal setting* 
Working hand-in-hand with Designing my own life, I would also want to work on multiple iterations of short term goals, and I feel that [Google's OKR](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) is a good starting framework to set goals. I aim to set goals in-line with what I want every 3 months, and iterate from there. I also aim to set goals that try to look for a healthy balance between maximizing short term goals and crisises, and the "Important, but not urgent" goals (in true 7 Habits of Highly Effective People fashion).

### *Finding and enforcing a balance*
Also part of Designing my life, I aim to find a healthy balance between work and play, and constantly think about the bigger picture even amidst tough times. Part of this is to rely less on my [panic monster](http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html), and stay ahead of the game through effective time management and planning, and not putting too much on my plate. OKRs and Life Design tactics should prevent situations such as these from happening on a daily basis.

### *Empathy for other people's problems*
I never want to feel that other people's problems are smaller than my own; they usually never are. I want to understand my peers and others more to facilitate greater empathy for them. A good strategy to encapsulate helping others is the [5 minute favor](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kareanderson/2013/07/17/pay-it-forward-with-the-five-minute-favor/#ca3aa336f5db) by Adam Grant, and I hope to apply this to my life.

### *Build a community around myself*
I feel that building a strong network / community around yourself is a mutually beneficial thing. You are the average of the 5 people you hang around with the most according to [Jim Rohn](http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-rohn-youre-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend-the-most-time-with-2012-7), and I feel that the people you hang around with have a huge impact on an individual as a person. Finding a mutually supportive network is also part of my reasons for my participation in the NOC program. 

Definitely, many of these changes may take time to implement, but are steps I feel is necessary for my personal growth.
