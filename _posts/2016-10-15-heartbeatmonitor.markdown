Robust heart beat monitor built on top of basic analog components like LM358 Op Amps. The underlying technology makes use of captures PPG signals through IR sensors and filtering. A remote transmission and receiving tool was also built using IR transmitters and receviers, and using digital logic, the receiver circuit was also able to detect tachycardia (abnormally fast heart rate). This was built as part of the [Circuit and Systems Design Lab](https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/cors/jsp/report/ModuleDetailedInfo.jsp?acad_y=2014/2015&sem_c=1&mod_c=EE2031) taken in the National University of Singapore.
