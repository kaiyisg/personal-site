Arduino-based car that tracks a black colored path on a white background, navigating the path based on the amount of light reflected back onto an attached light dependent resistor. This project was built during [Introduction to Circuits and Systems](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg/lms/public/view_moduleoutline.aspx?CourseID=9E4E08F9-C7EE-43A3-94A6-2F3BFEBF26EB&ClickFrom=StuViewBtn) taken in the National University of Singapore, and the car project came in the fastest in the laboratory group.
